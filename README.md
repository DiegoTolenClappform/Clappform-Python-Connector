# Python API Connector
## General Information

This connector is an interface to be used by App Developers to swiftly write (import) scripts in Python in combination with the storing of said data in Clappform.

This connector comes pre-installed on every instance of Clappform and can be imported into a python script with the following command:
```python
import Clappform
```

If you wish to use this connector locally for testing purposes you can install it using:
```bash
pip install Clappform
```

Now the interface is accessible in your code by prefixing with 'Clappform'. The only other method that's in every case needed it the instantiating of the authentication handler which will be described in the next chapter. Additional info can be given programmatically by using Python's help() function on any of this modules classes.

**DISCLAIMER:** *Use this connector wisely and with caution. Always make sure you're working with backups and test data. Otherwise important data or progress can be lost. Usage of the API or altering scripts made by Clappform can lead to losing warranty on your data.*

## Authentication
All authentication is handled by the Auth class. The Auth class is exposed through Clappform and needs to be initiated before any other commands, all authentication afterwards will be handled (including refreshing the token). Three parameters are needed: the base URL of the environment to authenticate towards (ex. https://dev.clappform.com/), the username and the password. The class has more exposed function, but those are only needed for the handler.

```python
Clappform.Auth(baseURL="https://dev.clappform.com/", username="test@clappform.com", password="test")
```

**NOTE:** *It's strongly recommended to create per environment a seperate user for the importing scripts* 

# Exposed Classes
In this section all the available functions of the module will be described.

## App
### Read
The Read() function returns an JSON array with all the apps known to this Clappform instance. Additionally the extended parameter can be passed (defaulting to False) in order to expand the data of the collections in the app.

```python
Clappform.App.Read(extended=True)
```

### ReadOne
The ReadOne() function returns a JSON object with the requested app. It's id needs to have been passed to the class in order to read the app. An exception will be raised upon not finding the app. Additionally the extended parameter can be passed (defaulting to False) in order to expand the data of the collections in the app.

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").ReadOne(extended=True)
```

### Create
The Create() function returns an instance of the App class containing the correct id if the app has been created, otherwise it will raise an exception. For instance an exception will be thrown if the app already exists. The required parameters are: id (Unique, lowercase and seperation by underscores), name, description and icon (ex. "home-icon").

```python
Clappform.App.Create(id="test_app", name="Test App", description="This app gives ... insights on ... subject.", icon="home-icon")
```

### Update
The Update() function returns an instance of the App class containing the correct id if the app has been updated successfully, otherwise it will raise an exception. For instance an exception will be thrown if the app couldn't be found. The app's id needs to have been passed to the class in order to update the app. The optional parameters are: name, description and icon (ex. "home-icon").

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Update(name="App")
```

### Delete
The Delete() function returns True upon deletion and raises an exception otherwise. For instance an exception will be thrown if the app couldn't be found. The app's id needs to have been passed to the class in order to delete the app.

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Delete()
```

## Collection
The Collection() function returns an instance of the Collection class. An collection's id can be passed to be able to read, update or delete a specific collection.

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Collection("test_collection")
```

### Collection
### ReadOne
The ReadOne() function returns a JSON object with the requested collection. It's slug needs to have been passed to the class in order to read the collection. An exception will be raised upon not finding the collection. Additionally the extended parameter can be passed (defaulting to False) in order to expand the data of the items in the collection. If the collection is locked, setting the 'Original' parameter to equal False will show the data after the lock occured.

```python

```

### Create
The Create() function returns an instance of the Collection class containing the correct slug if the collection has been created, otherwise it will raise an exception. For instance an exception will be thrown if the collection already exists. The required parameters are: id (Unique, lowercase and separation by underscores), name, description, encryption (Boolean, preferably off for performance but must be on if it will contain personal data), logging (Boolean, Set to true if the collection needs to be logged in the admin panel, we suggest setting this to true if all changes to the collection needs to be tracked) and sources (list of resources used from where the data in the collection was gathered, defaults to an empty array).

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Collection().Create(slug="test_collection", name="Test Collection", description="This collection stores data about ... and is used in ...", encryption=True, logging=True, sources=[{ "name": "Online resource", "link": "https://www.example.com/" }, "Name without link"])

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Collection("test_collection").Update(name="Collection")
```

### Delete
The Delete() function returns True upon successful deletion and raises an exception otherwise. For instance an exception will be thrown if the collection couldn't be found. The collection's slug needs to have been passed to the class in order to delete the collection.

```

### Lock
The Lock() function returns True upon success. It duplicates the current collection so one can be read by the user whilst the new one is being worked at. The new data can be read by using the parameter Original and setting it to equal false for the read function being used. The collection's slug needs to have been passed to the class in order to empty the collection.

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Collection("test_collection").Lock()
```

After running this function all the changes that have been made to the collection will be served to the users. The collection's slug needs to have been passed to the class in order to empty the collection.

```python
Clappform.App("test_app").Collection("test_collection").Unlock()
```
